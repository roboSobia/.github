# Tactic

Hey there! Welcome to **Tactic** — we're a group of undergrads from Cairo University putting together a collection of small (but fun) projects as part of our Advanced Microprocessors course (second year, Engineering).

## Projects

- **[Shell-Game](https://github.com/tactic/Shell-Game)**  
  A basic shell game with simple logic and player interaction. Just a fun way to get comfortable with Python.

- **[Target-Shooting](https://github.com/tactic/Target-Shooting)**  
  A quick target shooting game — helps us understand timing and scoring.

- **[Memory-Matching-Game](https://github.com/tactic/Memory-Matching-Game)**  
  Flip the cards, find the pairs. We built this to practice memory logic and grid-based UI.

- **[Rubik’s Cube Solver](https://github.com/tactic/Rubik-s-Cube-Solver)**  
  One of our more algorithm-heavy projects — it tries to solve a Rubik’s Cube using basic optimization techniques.

- **[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/tactic/Tic-Tac-Toe)**  
  Classic game, but we threw in some logic for a simple AI opponent.

Thanks for stopping by **Tactic**!
